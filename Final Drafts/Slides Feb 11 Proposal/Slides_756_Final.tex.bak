\section*{Intro}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Background and Motivation}
\begin{enumerate}

\item<2-| alert@2> Several diseases have been found to be related to white matter loss in brain, such as Autism (Vidal 2006) and ADHD (Luders 2009). Here, we measure white matter loss based the thickness of the mid-sagittal slice of the corpus callosum (CC), the largest white matter structure in brain.\vspace{.3cm}

\item<3-| alert@3> Our objective: To analyze the link between white matter thickness along the CC, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Specifically, if there are regions of the CC that are predictive of EDSS score, we want to find out where they are. \vspace{.3cm}

\item<4-| alert@4> Today we'll present a simulation study on our proposed method.
\end{enumerate}

\item<2-| alert@2> 176 patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), 466 scans.\\
\item<3-| alert@3> EDSS score is ranging from 0 to 8.5, higher value suggests worse situation of disease.

For ease of computation, we first generate $Y_i$, ($i=1,2,...I$) and then generate $I$ shapes with features of the $i^{th}$ shape determined by the value of $Y_i$.

\bi
\item<3-| alert@3>Case 1: I=300, response $Y_i\sim \text{Possion}(\lambda=3)$. Thickness of image$_i$ within $(\frac{\pi}{3},\frac{3\pi}{4})$ and $(\frac{5\pi}{4},\frac{7\pi}{4})$ is related to $Y_i$.

This could be made to account for measurement error by letting: $W_i(t)=
\sum_{k=1}^{K_x} \xi_{ik} \Psi_k(t) + \epsilon_i(t)$, and assigning priors for $\epsilon_i(t)$ and $\xi_{ik}$.\vspace{.1cm}

 Fit this in WinBUGS. All parameters mixed well except $\tau_\beta$.\footnote{(Crainiceanu and Goldsmith 2010; Brezger, Kneib, and Lang 2005; Lang and Brezger 2004; Goldsmith, Feder, Crainiceanu, Caffo, and Reich, 2010)}

\item Pointwise credible intervals give the range along the curve where 95\% of the points will fall
 \ilist{To estimate this, we need the quantiles for $\beta_d(t)$.}
\item  Joint credible intervals give the area within which 95\% of the curves will be completely contained
\ilist{Roughly speaking, we need the quantiles for each curve's largest deviation from the mean curve.}

\item<1-| alert@1> The joint CI never rises above zero, but the pointwise CI does at several points. These points could be the subject of future tests, if these were real data. \vspace{.4cm}

\item<2-| alert@2> With respect to the simulation:
\ilist{In our favor, not much non-noise signal in $X(t)$, so PCA works well.}
\ilist{Against us, the true underlying $\beta(t)$ is not smooth.}
\item<3-| alert@3> Principle curve procedure sometimes doesn't work so well at the end points, it they are especially thick.
\item<3-| alert@3> Results are slightly sensitive to number of splines chosen.
\item<4-| alert@4> Pipeline is good,
\item<5-| alert@5> but hard. \ilist{Make sure one step are not throwing garbage into the next one.}
